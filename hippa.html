  <h1>HIPPA Privacy Disclaimer</h1>
<p>No images are collected with patient names associated in any way. No patient information is stored at all. This includes emails, phone numbers, identifiable marks, names, etc. All stored images are used only for creation of the machine learning model which diagnosis malignant and benign moles. No patient information is stored along with images, nor individually. All images collected are anonymous. Dermatologists have no liability in reporting images, and all HIPPA concerns are to be addressed to Tonnelier Technologies. Dermatologist information is collected with regard to images. Information collected includes first and last name and email - purely for contact purposes. No additional metadata other than the aforementioned data is collected. No identifiable information is collected in photos. Photos are to be close up images of skin lesions only. Any photo that shows individually identifiable information is considered PHI. This can be something such as a patientâ€™s face, name or initials, their date of birth, the date of their treatment or photos of any birthmarks, moles or tattoos.

If patient photos are solely used for healthcare operations like training or teaching, then they do not need express consent but photos for external use like conferences or seminars do need explicit patient consent or release. For any use, only photos where all the potential identifiers have been entirely removed are considered to be safe from exposing PHI (Visit <a href="https://www.accountablehq.com/post/hipaa-and-photography#:~:text=What%20Pictures%20Qualify%20as%20Protected,any%20birthmarks%2C%20moles%20or%20tattoos."></a> for more detailed information). Images collected are purely for use in the training of the app, and are not viewed by any third party members, nor stored by any third party members. All photos are deleted after implementation in the machine learning model, and are not stored for an indefinite amount of time. All images are destroyed after 1 week of storage. Images are stored in Amazon web services, a HIPPA compliant photo storage option. </p>
